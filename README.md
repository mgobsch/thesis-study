# SmartEx User Study – Smart Office

This repository contains the online user study for my bachelor's thesis at the University of Cologne. The thesis looks at **LLM-generated contrastive explanations** for a smart office: explanations that answer questions like *"Why is the status light orange and not green?"*

The whole study is **one web page** (`index.html`). Participants do not play a role: they follow Alice and Bob, two employees, through three situations in a small smart office (stories in third person) and judge SmartEx's explanations for them.

## Two ways to run the study

| Mode | Setting | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| **Standalone** (default) | `LIMESURVEY_MODE: false` | Participants open the study link. Consent and "About you" happen on the page. |
| **With LimeSurvey** | `LIMESURVEY_MODE: true` | Participants start in LimeSurvey (consent, demographics, CAPTCHA). LimeSurvey forwards them to the page with their response ID (`?ls={SAVEDID}`). The page skips its own consent and "About you" and saves the ID as `ls_id`. |

In LimeSurvey mode, the page only starts with a code. Without one, it shows "Please start the study here" with a link to LimeSurvey (`LIMESURVEY_URL`). In `TEST_MODE` it also runs without a code, so you can keep testing.

**LimeSurvey settings used:** anonymised responses on, IP address off, timings on, CAPTCHA on, End URL `https://mgobsch.github.io/thesis-study/?ls={SAVEDID}` with "Automatically load end URL" on. The language of the link (`lang=de` / `lang=en`) is passed on to the page.

**Matching the data:** `ls_id` in the Google Sheet = response ID in LimeSurvey. Rows without a matching LimeSurvey ID should be excluded.

## What participants do

About 15–20 minutes, in English or German (switch at the top right). Every screen has a "What to do" box.

1. **Welcome and consent** *(standalone mode only)*
2. **About you:** age, familiarity with smart devices, technical background *(standalone mode only)*
3. **The smart office:** the meeting room, the status light, the smart office system and SmartEx. A yellow note above the clock (and the "Times" section of the office note) shows office hours 08:00–18:00, lunchtime 11:00–13:00 and closing time 18:00–23:00
4. **The smart devices:** click on 7 devices (door sensor, motion sensor, status light, forecast, clock, smoke/CO₂ detector, fan)
5. **The office rules:** all 6 rules that change the status light, with a note that some rules may seem confusing and that this is normal. From here on, the yellow **office note** is available. It starts closed (a tab at the edge) and a red hint shows where to open it. In the office note, each rule is a card with a coloured stripe (the light colour), like on the rules page.
6. **Alice and Bob:** the two employees and their technical level. In each situation, one of them asks SmartEx something.
7. **Quick check:** 3 questions (answer order shuffled per participant)
8. **Three situations,** always in the same order by time of day: **TC3 (08:00) → TC1 (12:08) → TC2 (12:10)**, each with three steps:
   - **Story:** what Alice or Bob sees at that moment (third person)
   - **Ask SmartEx:** Alice/Bob asks SmartEx. The participant first chooses **which colour they think Alice/Bob expected** instead, then places the **two rules they think Alice/Bob expected most** (all rules except the one that is currently active) on places 1 and 2, and locks them in. Rules the person created carry a **"Created by Alice" / "Created by Bob"** tag as a hint.
   - **Rate the explanations:** two or three explanations (A, B, C), each rated **with Alice/Bob in mind** (Alice: knows a bit about technology; Bob: not technical, prefers short, everyday language): two statements on a 1–5 scale (*"The wording of this explanation is easy for Alice to understand"*, *"After reading this explanation, Alice knows why the status light is orange"*), a length choice (*too short / about right / too long*), then **which explanation is best for Alice/Bob** and a comprehension question.
9. **Final questions:** attention check and optional feedback
10. **End:** answers are sent to the Google Sheet

### The three situations

| Situation | Persona | What happens | Status light |
|---|---|---|---|
| TC3 | Alice | 08:00, sunny. Alice is the first one in the office (so nobody is in the meeting room). The door is slightly open (shown in the picture, not in the story). | off |
| TC1 | Alice | 12:08, rain. A meeting just ended, people are standing in the hallway. The door is closed (shown in the picture, not in the story). | orange |
| TC2 | Bob | 12:10, rain, lunchtime. A meeting just ended, people are standing in front of the meeting room. The door is closed (shown in the picture, not in the story). | orange |

### The explanations

Participants rate the explanations in random order (they only see "A", "B" and "C"):

- **C0:** the SmartEx baseline explanation (reworded for readability)
- **C2:** GPT-OSS + prompt P1 (zero-shot) + configuration C2 (LLM-weighted TOPSIS)
- **C3:** GPT-OSS + prompt P1 (zero-shot) + configuration C3 (LLM foil selection)

| `VARIANT` | Explanations per situation |
|---|---|
| `"C2_C3"` (default) | C0 + C2 + C3 (three) |
| `"C2"` | C0 + C2 (two) |

The same trial is used for every participant (only trials without hallucinations):

| Situation | C2 | C3 |
|---|---|---|
| TC1 | Trial 2 | Trial 1 |
| TC2 | Trial 2 | Trial 1 |
| TC3 | Trial 1 | Trial 3 |

The German explanations are DeepL translations of the English originals (with small corrections).

## Testing

| Mode | How | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Preview** | link with `?preview=1`, or `PREVIEW_MODE: true` | Click through freely: nothing is saved, no answers are required, the LimeSurvey note is skipped. A purple bar shows "Preview mode – nothing is saved" and a **"Jump to"** menu with every screen. |
| **Test mode** | `TEST_MODE: true` | Everything works as for real and **is saved** to the sheet. The end screen shows the collected data. **Set to `false` before the real study.** |

Tip: `?preview=1&lang=de` opens the preview in German. Always test in a **private window**, so no saved session is resumed.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The complete study: design, texts, logic and saving |
| `README.md` | This file |

The Google Apps Script (`Code.gs`) lives in the Google Sheet under **Extensions → Apps Script**.

---

## How the answers are saved

```
Participant's browser  ──►  Google Apps Script (web app)  ──►  Google Sheet
     (index.html)             receives the answers             stores one row per person
```

- The page sends the answers to the web-app URL in `SAVE_URL`.
- A row is written **after each situation** and **updated at the end**.
- The Google Sheet has two tabs (names are set in `Code.gs`):
  - **Answers:** one row per participant, all values in columns
  - **Raw Data:** the complete raw data as JSON (backup)
- New columns are added automatically at the **right end** of the sheet.
- If a participant closes the tab, they can continue where they left off in the same browser.
- If sending fails at the end, a "Try again" button and a tip about Brave/ad blockers appear.

**After changing `Code.gs`:** Save → Deploy → **Manage deployments** → pencil icon → Version **"New version"** → Deploy. (Not "New deployment", which creates a new URL.)

To analyse in Excel: Google Sheet → **File → Download → Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)**.

### Important columns (tab "Answers")

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pid` | anonymous participant ID |
| `ls_id`, `limesurvey_mode` | LimeSurvey response ID (empty in standalone mode) and whether LimeSurvey mode was on |
| `finished` | TRUE = completed the whole study |
| `order` | order of the situations (always "TC3 TC1 TC2") |
| `age`, `smarthome_familiarity`, `tech_background` | only in standalone mode (in LimeSurvey mode, this is in LimeSurvey) |
| `quiz_correct` | correct answers in the quick check (0–3) |
| `attention_passed` | attention check passed (TRUE/FALSE) |
| `TC1_expected_colour` | colour the participant expected instead (green, orange, blue, off) |
| `TC1_rank_locked` | the two rules placed, e.g. "notoccupied > rain" |
| `TC1_rank_first` | the rule placed first (the expected foil) |
| `TC1_rank_moves` | how often tiles were moved |
| `TC1_A_is`, `TC1_B_is`, `TC1_C_is` | which explanation was shown as A, B and C |
| `TC1_C2_trial`, `TC1_C3_trial` | GPT-OSS trials used (C3 empty in variant "C2") |
| `variant`, `model` | which variant was running, and the model (GPT-OSS P1) |

| `TC1_C0_underst`, `TC1_C0_knowswhy` … `TC1_C3_knowswhy` | ratings 1–5 (wording easy to understand, knows why the light has this colour), mapped to C0, C2 and C3 |
| `TC1_C0_length` … `TC1_C3_length` | length for Alice/Bob: `too_short`, `about_right`, `too_long` |
| `TC1_mcq_correct` | comprehension question correct (TRUE/FALSE) |
| `total_time_min` | total duration in minutes |

The same columns exist for TC2 and TC3.

**Rule IDs:** `notoccupied` = Meeting Room Not Occupied, `occupied` = Meeting Room Occupied, `rain` = Rain at Lunch, `sunny` = Sunny at Lunch, `danger` = Danger, `closing` = Closing Time.

---

## Quality and bot checks

The page measures the time on each screen and adds warning flags to every row. **Nobody is excluded automatically.**

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `time_<screen>_s` | seconds on each screen, e.g. `time_devices_s`, `time_TC1_rank_s`, `time_TC1_rate_s` |
| `TC1_rate_min_reading_s` | minimum time needed to read the explanations at `READING_WPM` |
| `TC1_straightlining` | TRUE = all 1–5 ratings in this situation have the same value (the length choice is not included) |
| `flag_too_fast` | whole study faster than `MIN_TOTAL_MINUTES`, or a rating page faster than its reading time |
| `flag_straightlining` | straightlining in at least one situation |
| `flag_no_pointer` | no mouse, touch or scroll activity at all |
| `flag_webdriver` | the browser reports that it is remote-controlled |
| `flag_honeypot` | an invisible field on "The smart office" page was filled in |
| `pointer_moves` | number of mouse/touch/scroll events |
| `bot_score` | number of flags that apply (0 = unremarkable) |

Decide before data collection which rule leads to exclusion (for example: attention check failed or `bot_score` ≥ 2) and report it in the method section.

## How to change things

All content is in clearly marked blocks at the top of the `<script>` part of `index.html`. Edit on GitHub: open `index.html` → **pencil icon** → change → **Commit changes**. The page updates after about 1 minute.

| Block | What you can change there |
|---|---|
| `SETTINGS` | all switches (see below) |
| `STATS` | how often each rule was fired / explained (only shown with `CONTEXT_MODE: "all"`) |
| `EXPLANATION_TRIALS` | which trials are recorded in the sheet |
| `RANK_PLACES` | how many rules participants place (currently 2) |
| `RULES` | rule names, "Starts when" / "Only if" texts, owners |
| `SCENARIOS` | stories, situation details, candidate rules, explanations, comprehension questions |
| `T` | every other text, in English (`en`) and German (`de`) |

### Settings

| Setting | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TEST_MODE` | `true` / `false` | shows the collected data at the end; **`false` for the real study** |
| `PREVIEW_MODE` | `true` / `false` | preview for everyone (nothing saved); usually use `?preview=1` instead |
| `SAVE_URL` | web-app URL | where answers are sent |
| `LIMESURVEY_MODE` | `true` / `false` | start via LimeSurvey (see above) |
| `LIMESURVEY_URL` | URL | LimeSurvey link shown when the page is opened without a code |
| `VARIANT` | `"C2_C3"` / `"C2"` | three or two explanations |
| `MIN_TOTAL_MINUTES` | number (5) | faster → `flag_too_fast` |
| `READING_WPM` | number (300) | reading speed for the rating-page check |
| `CONTEXT_MODE` | `"basic"` / `"all"` / `"split"` | rule context in the office note |
| `SURVEY_RETURN_URL` | URL or `""` | optional button on the end screen |

### Editing tips

- Only change text **inside the quotation marks** `"…"`. Keep every comma, quote mark and bracket.
- Quotation marks inside a text must be typographic („…“ or “…”), not plain `"`.
- Don't edit the file in TextEdit's formatted mode; use GitHub or a code editor.
- After every change, check it with the preview link.
- Avoid changing texts during data collection. If you have to, note the date.

## Before the real study (checklist)

- [ ] Google Sheet and Apps Script set up, web-app access **"Anyone"**, tab names in `Code.gs` match the sheet
- [ ] One complete test run (`TEST_MODE: true`), row appears in the sheet
- [ ] Decide: standalone or LimeSurvey mode, and set `LIMESURVEY_MODE`
- [ ] Test rows deleted from both tabs (keep the header row)
- [ ] `TEST_MODE` set to `false`
- [ ] Data protection and consent text checked with the supervisor
- [ ] Exclusion rule decided (attention check, `bot_score`)
- [ ] Pilot with 1–2 people, feedback included
- [ ] Link sent, with the note: laptop or PC, Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge (not Brave / ad blockers)

---

## Randomisation

The order of the situations is **fixed** (TC3 → TC1 → TC2, by time of day). Note for the thesis: situation and position cannot be separated (e.g. fatigue in TC2).

Per participant, and saved with the answers:

- which explanation is shown as A, B and C
- the starting order of the rule tiles
- the answer order in the quick check and in the comprehension questions

---

## Data protection

- No names, e-mail addresses or IP addresses are collected by the page. Each participant gets a random ID.
- Answers are stored in a Google Sheet (Google servers). This must be mentioned in the consent text (in LimeSurvey or on the page).
- In LimeSurvey mode, part 1 runs on the University of Cologne's LimeSurvey server with anonymised responses.
- The page is hosted on GitHub Pages and loads its font from Google Fonts.

---

## Technical notes

- One self-contained HTML file: plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no build step.
- Works in current Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge, on laptops and phones.
- The office drawing is inline SVG, so no image files are needed.
- Progress is stored in `localStorage` and removed after the study is finished (not in preview mode).
